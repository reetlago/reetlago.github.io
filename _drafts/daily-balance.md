reason: While writing only the third daily reflection, I was struck with how creating yet another motivational daybook is kinda boring; adding a darker side makes this work unique and offers a good writing challenge.

## January 1

Today is going to be special. Overnight a great "reset" has taken place and it's made it so that for the next days and weeks, every experience can be a "first" again. With just a change in perspective, the world can look brand like new. Witness the first sunrise, the first contact with water, the first taste of food, the first breath of outside air, the first interaction with another being. All experiences of yesterday, whatever their quality, can be made meaningful on this special first day.

Today is also about the number 1. As a bold first step into the new year, let's decide on a single--but meaningful--resolution. (After all, "1" also refers to the "self".) The reason for a singular intention is that it's simply much easier to remember just one thing. But over a lifetime, one change per calendar year still adds up to an exemplary self-development track record.

So what is a negative repeating pattern that needs breaking? What is preventing that sense of purpose to come out? What personal trait is in the way of feeling alive? Or on a larger community level, what change does the world need? How to become a better human being? 

Reflect on this and pick something that really strikes a chord inside and is possible to commit to. Easy does it, but take that first step today.

[1/1/16 ~6-7pm, then on and off until 9:30pm]

## January 2

While yesterday was rather introspective, focus for this second day of the year can be on the "other" that the number 2 represents. For example, the other person, the other viewpoint, or even the other side of the world. Is it possible to relate to what's going on with that "other"? That's the challenge for today.

Being open to what that "other" represents is a good first step. Perhaps you're a good listener, you have a vivid imagination or you are naturally curious about things. You can hear words of criticism. You accept failure as part of the learning process. The other is by definition apart from you, but outside influence is often good and helps shape your character.

The "other side" is not necessarily an opposite; it can also be complimentary like a partnership or team. Along the same lines, it isn't necessarily dualistic either: there are many shades between two extremes. In fact, two persons can form a partnership where each person complements the other. 
Sometimes, the "other" is the unknown

words starting with "bi". bipartisan, binary

partner, binary, even, prime, duality
Now it's time to think about somebody else. It takes two to do many things. 
Special day today?
Go for seconds
Remember your firsts?

A leap year comes around every 4 years (except for years divisible by 100... except for years also divisible by 400). Today is a good time to think about what you haven't done _in years_. Something you liked doing when you were younger but for one reason or another don't get around of anymore. A forgotten friend you always enjoyed spending time with but due to schedules, distance or the mere passing of time have lost sight of. Or perhaps a memorable place you haven't seen in a long while. The kind of activity that if someone were to ask you what you used to love doing, you'd answer: oh, I _always_ used to... Today, make time to do that again.

Ever increasing responsibilities often change our habits.
