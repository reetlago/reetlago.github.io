Congratulations, graduates, congratulations!

Today marks an important milestone in your lives: you have reached the end of a _major_ educational journey. As of today, you are "privileged." Economically speaking, your chances of having a good life have gone up quite a bit and the degree you have earned has the power to open doors that remain closed to others. Now by no means am I saying that "You've made it! You're done!" but during your time here you _have_ cultivated--_and_ demonstrated proviciency with--the tools required to get there.

Okay, sure, you're able to learn stuff. You're able to say stuff, deduce stuff, make stuff, _complete_ stuff... and you're _awesome_ for being able to do all those things (and I know it wasn't easy). But like any journey, today also marks the completion of a major phase in your _personal_ development. Now _I_ think the lessons learned in the classroom of "self" will, in the end, prove to be your most valuable tools. They are generally applicable yet individual. They are foundational and thus reliable. They are easily tested and you will find they're always directly responsible for the quality of your life.

But to recognize these character-shaping lessons requires you to take pause and reflect back on the road behind you. Not to agonize over or judge, but to see the actions you yourself took, why you took them and what that means for the kind of person you _really_ are. (See, that was you back there doing those things!)

So getting a degree brings freedom, but it also brings expectation.?know
People will demand stuff from you.

Did you move out on your own and sleep on the hard floor for a few weeks until you were able to buy a mattress or a chair? Realize you started with nothing and you still made it. So whatever happens next, even if you lose _everything_, you know you can start again and it's going to be okay. 
Even if your parents or caregivers moved you into a mansion and you didn't have to worry about tuition or having enough to eat, realize that--unless they bought your degree as well--there were still things you had to do to get there. Things you may not have liked to do at the time, but were necessary to ensure the end goal. Now those are character traits and even without that initial cushion, those character traits you can build on, and moreover you can count on in times of need.

You know actions speak louder than words and you take responsibility for your actions. You're an educated person, you can look at this objectively and advice yourself. Only you know what kind of person you want to be, so only you can become that person. And by being one of the graduates here today, you just proved you have what it takes to do it. So look back once in a while and see what needs to change, if any. 




So my ask is this: in between celebrating and starting your next adventure, take a moment to reflect on what has happened to you and what you personally went through. Write down the instances where you were tested and you did the right thing. Based on your actions overall, what do you stand for? What kind of person are you? What advice would you give your future self? Write it all down and make an appointment with yourself for the same time next year so you can revisit your own words and gauge how you're changing over time. In fact make it a recurring yearly meeting.

Never forget you are responsible for yourself and the people and causes you care about. 


How about self-motivation? If you held a job to pay for tuition, you know 

Freedom: today is one of those moments where you feel truly free.




character building / career building


kHow about self-motivation, determination, ingenuity, passion. 

Now back to those open doors. Know that you are privileged. Doors that open to you may remain closed for others. Know that many are not as fortunate as you. But--if you keep being alert--you have the power to help.

Today also marks the completion of a major phase in your personal development. My hope is that you had many new experiences and that inside and outside the classroom, you made it count. The journey ahead will be different. Be sure to take a moment and reflect on what you've learned, what your values are / what you stand for.

As you gain experience in your careers 

1/2 way through your career, start thinking about how to make yourself obsolete. Automate what you do. Teach others what you do. Give away your secrets--trust me, they're fleeting anyway. Become an advisor. Find another career.

Remember you started with nothing. An empty room, your first mattress, your first table and chair. 

Although you probably have debt now, don't let money drive your decisions. Do what is right.
