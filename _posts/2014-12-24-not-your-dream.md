If the world
   meets your expectations not
People left passively cold--
   rather than acting passionately hot--
Conforming to some mould
   created and instated by the ruling lot

I stand with you within arm's length 
(your heart is beautiful)

We support you--channel your inner strength
(your mind is just)

Open your eyes my dear
   this is not your dream to dream
Your version of Future's tale
   others have yet to gleam
Know you're not alone--
   a better world _is_ possible--
   the masses are not what they seem
