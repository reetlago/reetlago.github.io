Tired of being tired
Of eyelids half shut
Longing for an anti-dote to loneliness
Hey buddy, got any for my rut?

Trying to be trying
It's _such_ an effort to even get up
Again progress is not being made today
My gaze landing on an empty cup

Feeling the weight of gravitation's pull
Shoulders lunged forwards, head not held back
It's another day tomorrow
Another chance to get back on track
