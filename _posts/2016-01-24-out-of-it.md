Tired of being tired
Of eyelids half shut
Longing for an anti-dote to loneliness
Hey buddy, got anything for a rut?

Trying to be trying
It's _such_ an effort to even get up
Again progress is not being made today
Gaze locked onto an empty cup

Feeling the weight of gravity's pull
Shoulders lunged forwards, head not held back
It's a new day tomorrow
Another chance to get on track
