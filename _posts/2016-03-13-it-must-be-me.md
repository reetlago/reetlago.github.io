I moved to Spain
But what remained
was the pain
It must be me
It must be me

You called me a name
Yet I'm still to blame
It's always the same
It must be me
It must be me

Out in the rain
My last bit of sane
Seeps slowly down the drain
It must be me
It must be me

Heart heavy like a sack of grain
What is needed is a crane
To lift the veil of _plain_
It must be me
It must be me

A new connection in my brain
Brings me back to the main
There is much to gain
It must be me
It must be me
