Tony stopped and leaned against one of the few remaining light posts scattered about Main Street--the unyielding rounded steel shell wedged between shoulder blade and spine gave some welcome relief from the force of gravity.

Once a welcome pitstop for passers-through who not only brought full bladders and empty stomachs but also cash, it was fastly becoming a ghost town. Even _if_ outsiders came to witness the curiosity of it all, noone cared enough--or felt comfortable enough--to stop.

And so, although Tony had stood there many times before, he had become more of a witness of time rather than a spectator of life. Indeed, why was Tony even there? He had asked himself that very question earlier that day, when his young and spirited eyes looked at his middle-aged face reflected in the old 2-pump gas station's rusty bathroom mirror.

"What the hell am I still doing here?"
